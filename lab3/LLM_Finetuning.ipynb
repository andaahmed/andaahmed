        "\n",
        "Fine-tuning is a technique that allows us to adapt a pre-trained neural network to better suit a downstream task, domain, or style, by training the model further on new data. By training the model further on a carefully curated dataset, we can modify its behavior, style, or capabilities. Fine-tuning is used in a variety of applications, not just language modeling. But in language modeling, fine-tuning can be used to:\n",
        "- Adapt the model's writing style\n",
        "- Improve performance on specific tasks or domains\n",
        "- Teach the model new capabilities or knowledge\n",
        "- Reduce unwanted behaviors or biases\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, you will fine-tune the Gemma LLM to adapt the model's writing style. Recall that in Lab 1 you built out a RNN-based sequence model to generate Irish folk songs. Continuing with our Irish theme, we will first fine-tune the LLM to chat in the style of a leprechaun.\n",

Benchmarks are also limited in the scope of tasks they can cover and capabilities they can reflect, and there can be concerns about whether the data in the benchmark was used to train the model. Synthetic data generation and synthetic tasks are a way to address these limitations, and this is an active area of research.\n",

The larger LLM is used as a judge, and it is given a system prompt that describes the task we want the smaller LLM to perform and the judging criteria. A \"system prompt\" is a way to set the general context and guide an LLM's behavior. Contextualized with this system prompt, the judge LLM can score the outputs of the smaller LLM, and we can use this score to evaluate how well the smaller LLM is doing."
